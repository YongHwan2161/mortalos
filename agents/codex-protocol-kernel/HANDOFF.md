# Handoff and shared-path intent

This is an advisory conflict-avoidance ledger. It does not grant ownership over
shared project files and must not be used as a lock that blocks the project indefinitely.

## Active intent

None.

## Completed handoffs

### 2026-07-15 — Agent-isolated contribution and reviewer merge gate

- Base: `0a8ce3e2cf09a040758611b3674e92aa32e13c4b`
- Work branch: `agent/codex-protocol-kernel--agent-governance`
- Paths: `AGENTS.md`, `agents/**`, `docs/AGENT_COLLABORATION.md`,
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/workflows/pr-policy.yml`,
  `scripts/create-agent-worktree.mjs`, `scripts/verify-agent-pr.mjs`,
  `test/agent-governance.test.mjs`, `package.json`, and `.npmignore`
- Author validation: governance 10/10, full `npm test`, coverage, dependency audit,
  and actual Chromium differential verification passed
- Handoff: ready for immutable-head review by `reviewer-merge-gate`

## Before changing shared paths

Add an active entry containing:

- task and reason
- exact intended paths
- base `main` commit
- expected validation
- expected handoff or pull request

Then check the current remote `main`, open pull requests, and other agent ledgers.
If another agent is already modifying the same semantics, coordinate or split the
work before writing code.

## Handoff template

### `<status>` Task name

- From / to: `<agent-id>`
- Base: `<commit>`
- Intended paths: `<paths>`
- Contract affected: `<protocol/API/schema/docs>`
- Required evidence: `<tests or review>`
- Notes: `<short context>`
