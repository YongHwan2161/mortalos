# Handoff and shared-path intent

This is an advisory conflict-avoidance ledger. It does not grant ownership over
shared project files and must not be used as a lock that blocks the project indefinitely.

## Active intent

None. This bootstrap changes only `agents/README.md` and
`agents/codex-protocol-kernel/**` on the dedicated branch.

## Before changing shared paths

Add an active entry containing:

- task and reason
- exact intended paths
- base `main` commit
- expected validation
- expected handoff or pull request

Then check the current remote `main`, open pull requests, and other agent ledgers.
If another agent is already modifying the same semantics, coordinate or split the
work before writing code.

## Handoff template

### `<status>` Task name

- From / to: `<agent-id>`
- Base: `<commit>`
- Intended paths: `<paths>`
- Contract affected: `<protocol/API/schema/docs>`
- Required evidence: `<tests or review>`
- Notes: `<short context>`
